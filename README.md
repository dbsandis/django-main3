It's important to collaborate closely with addiction recovery experts, counselors, and staff members to define the specific needs and workflows of the recovery residences you're targeting. Additionally, consulting with legal experts to ensure compliance with relevant regulations is crucial.

Once you clearly understand the requirements, you can start designing and developing the Django application to meet those needs. You may also want to consider hosting the application securely to protect the sensitive data it will handle
 
1. **User Authentication and Roles:**
   - User authentication system with different roles (e.g., administrators, counselors, residents).
   - Role-based access control to restrict access to certain features and data.
SuperAdmin Role/User Manage Users
The Staff section of the Recovery Residence APP (RRA) Access Management page allows Super Admins or users with the Manage Users feature added to their profile to:
There are three main items that provide user permissions with the EMR: Roles, features, and functions. These features can work together to provide the right access and oversight to your user base. 
•	The role represents the various roles that users can have.
•	The feature represents additional access or permissions that users can assign based on their roles.
•	The function represents functions related to EvaluationForms and Flags, with associated roles and users.
•	EvaluationForm is a model for your evaluation forms, and it has methods to check if a user can view, complete, or sign a form.
•	Patients have assigned roles that determine a patient's access.
•	Flag represents flags that can be assigned to patients with associated roles.

•	Create New Users
o	Enter the user’s information. 
o	First Name, Middle Name, Last Name: The user's first and last name are required, middle is optional.
o	Alias: If the user has an alternate name they would prefer to use, enter it here.
o	Title: Enter the user's title.
o	Mobile: This number is helpful for two-factor authentication (if enabled).
o	NPI Number: Required for rendering providers when integrated with a billing system.
o	For Physicians: DEA Number: If the user is a physician, enter their DEA number. 
o	For Physicians: NADEAN Number: Enter the user's NADEAN Number. This field is not required, but filling it out will provide a more seamless experience.
o	State License: Use the drop-down list to select the state from which the user holds their license.

o	Set the Roles and Features for the user. These determine what the user can access. 
	Reporting Period

o	Use the Function drop-down to set form and flag access.
o	Restrict access to certain patients, if needed. Type in the patient’s name. Using the checkbox, you can also restrict this user’s access to only patients in their caseload.
o	Click Register and Invite. This automatically sends an invite email to the user to create a password and log into the Recovery Residence APP (RRA) EMR. Note: Invitations expire after 48 hours.

•	Restrict users from accessing specific patient charts
•	Update login security settings (Super Admins only) 
You can further customize these models and add the logic needed for checking permissions based on your application's roles, features, and functions. Additionally, you may want to use Django's built-in permissions system to manage permissions more granularly.
